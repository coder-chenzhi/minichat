A simple python chat app (demo) writtern with flask and gevent.

A demo from [Gevent-tutorial](http://xlambda.com/gevent-tutorial)

I forked this repository, because I want to benchmark the performance of gevent. But after I read the code, I don't think this repository suits for bechmarking.

To use it:  
`sudo apt-get install libev-dev libevent-dev python-all-dev -y`  
`pip install gevent flask`  
`python app.py`  
... and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use it.
